#PHL API

A collection of open data APIs from the City of Philadelphia.

This website is meant to be a "landing page" for developers that want to learn more about open data and APIs from the City of Philadelphia. It is a prototyope of a larger Developer Center that will encompass more APIs and have more information - to be released in the near future.
